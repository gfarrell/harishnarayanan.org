Our media centre machine at home is an aging Mac with only one open
port: SSH. Since it was getting annoying to have to walk up to it
every time we wanted to control Spotify, I wrote [a simple Bash/Apple
script](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify) that allows us to
remotely control the program from other machines around the house.

With it, we can now do things like this:

Shpotify](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify) from the official
GitHub project page!
