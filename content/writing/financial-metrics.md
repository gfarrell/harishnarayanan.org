## Sharpe Ratio

The [Sharpe Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio) is a way of examining the performance of an investment by adjusting for its risk. It measures the excess return of your asset with respect to some benchmark per unit deviation of your asset (usually called *risk*).

Its definition has historically undergone a few changes, but the
current form is:

$$  \begin{aligned}
\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} &amp; = \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}} \\   \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} &amp; = 4 \pi \rho \\
\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} &amp; = \vec{\mathbf{0}} \\
\nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} &amp; = 0 \end{aligned}
$$

        S_p =    E(R_a - R_b)
              -------------------  ,
              sqrt(var(R_a - R_b))

where E(.) = Expected value of .
      var(.) = Variance of .
      R_a = Asset return
      R_b = Benchmark return

~~~python
def sharpe_ratio(asset_volatility, asset_return, benchmark_return):
    if approx_equals(volatility, 0):
        return 0.0

    return (asset_return - benchmark_return) / asset_volatility
